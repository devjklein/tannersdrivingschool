        <p class="lead">This website is part of the marketing campaign for a film project currently entitled "Crystal Falls Drive". <b>This is a work of fiction.</b> Names, characters, business, events and incidents on this site are the products of the creative team's imagination and artistry. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental. </p>
        <h2 class="pb-2 fw-bold border-bottom">What is Crystal Falls Drive?</h1>
        <p>Set in the fall of 2007, <i>Crystal Falls Drive</i> is dark comedy following a rural driving instructor as he struggles to keep a failing business afloat and help his teenage students cope with a local tragedy. It is a story incredibly near and dear to the hearts of our creative team, focusing on raising suicide awareness and prevention specifically in the teenage population. </p>
        <p>Through our initial fundraising efforts we have submitted our screenplay to various competitions including the prestigious Academy Nicholl Fellowships and the Austin Film Festival. Our current goal is to continue fundraising while completing video shorts as an online web series as well as a full length theatrical trailer. Thank you for your continued support in helping us create and share our vision!</p>
